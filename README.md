# eGain AI Guidance Widget

A comprehensive AI-powered guidance widget designed to provide intelligent customer support and problem-solving assistance. This widget can be embedded on any website and features an advanced admin panel for customization.

## Project Overview

This project implements a sophisticated guidance system that walks users through problem description, question answering, and solution delivery. The widget is built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Pinia for state management, demonstrating modern frontend development practices and user experience design.

## Development Process and Thought Process

### Research and Planning Phase

**User Journey Analysis**: I began by mapping the complete customer support journey, identifying key pain points where users need guidance. This involved analyzing existing support systems and identifying opportunities for improvement through intelligent automation.

**Competitive Analysis**: Studied existing chat widgets and support systems to understand current market standards and identify differentiation opportunities. This research informed the decision to create a multi-step guidance system rather than a simple chat interface.

**Technical Architecture Planning**: Evaluated various frontend frameworks and state management solutions, ultimately choosing Vue 3 with Composition API for its reactivity system and TypeScript for type safety. Pinia was selected for its simplicity and Vue 3 compatibility.

### Design and UX Strategy

**Multi-Modal Interaction Design**: Recognized that different users prefer different interaction patterns. Implemented both sequential (one question at a time) and batch (all questions visible) modes to accommodate various user preferences and cognitive loads.

**Progressive Disclosure**: Designed the interface to reveal information progressively, reducing cognitive overload while maintaining user engagement. This principle guided the step-by-step flow from problem description to solution.

**Visual Hierarchy and Accessibility**: Prioritized accessibility from the beginning, ensuring proper color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support. The design system was built with WCAG compliance in mind.

### Technical Implementation Strategy

**Component Architecture**: Designed a modular component system where each step (ProblemDescription, Questions, Solution, Feedback) is a separate, reusable component. This approach enables easy maintenance and future enhancements.

**State Management Design**: Implemented a centralized Pinia store to manage all widget state, ensuring predictable data flow and enabling complex state interactions between components.

**Responsive Design Philosophy**: Adopted a mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement, ensuring the widget works seamlessly across all device sizes and interaction methods.

## Core Features Implemented

### Interactive Guidance Widget System

**Multi-step User Flow**: Implemented a sophisticated flow from problem description through question answering to solution delivery and feedback collection. Each step is designed to gather specific information while maintaining user engagement.

**Floating Action Button**: Created an animated circular button that serves as the primary entry point when the widget is closed. The FAB includes logo display capabilities and smooth hover animations.

**Draggable Interface**: Implemented a sophisticated drag-and-drop system that allows users to reposition the widget anywhere on screen while maintaining viewport boundaries and smooth animations.

**Responsive Design**: Built adaptive layouts that work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices with appropriate breakpoints and touch-friendly interactions.

### Advanced Admin Panel (Widget Studio)

**Security Implementation**: Created a password-protected admin interface with secure authentication flow and session management.

**Design Customization System**: Built a comprehensive design tool with four main sections:
